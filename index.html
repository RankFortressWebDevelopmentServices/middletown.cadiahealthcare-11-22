                    Pre-operative education is important in order to understand what to expect during your rehabilitation

                <p>
                    It is essential to adhere to the pre-operative instructions given to you by your surgeon. These may include avoiding certain foods or supplements before surgery, stopping smoking, and reducing alcohol consumption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to have a support system in place during your rehabilitation. Family and friends can help you with tasks such as transportation, meals, and child care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your rehabilitation will be tailored to your individual needs. The length of time and intensity of therapy will depend on the type of surgery you had, as well as your overall health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of post-operative rehabilitation is to help you regain your strength and mobility. Physical therapists will work with you to create a custom rehabilitation plan.

                                After your surgery, you will be given specific instructions on how to care for your incisions. It is important that you follow these instructions carefully to avoid infection.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You will need to stay in the hospital for a few days after your surgery so that we can monitor your recovery.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Once you are discharged from the hospital, you will need to continue to follow your care instructions and come back for regular checkups. Post-operative rehabilitation can be a challenging time, but with the right preparation, you can make a successful recovery.
